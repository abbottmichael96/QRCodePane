### What I learned

Great CSS and Flexbox practice which never comes in wrong. 


```css
body {
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	height: 100vh;
}
```
